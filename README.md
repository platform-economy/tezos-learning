	How do public blockchains work?
	Overview of popular consensus mechanisms
	Key cryptography concepts

## Module 2 - Getting to Know Tezos
                        
Tezos introduces new concepts that differ from traditional approaches to system architecture. We will learn Tezos vocabulary and get acquainted with the architecture. You will also run your first node and interact with it using the command line interface and RPC calls

	Key Tezos overview: Introduction; Consensus
	Tezos Alphanet: Alphanet.sh, Command Line Interface, JSON/RPC interface

## Module 3 - Smart Contracts I

It is time to write and deploy smart contracts! We will start to code smart contracts with SmartPy in this module.

	Python: Basics, Modules.
	SmartPy

 ## Module 4 - Clients
                        
A regular user will not want to use the command line interface, so in this module we will see how you can write clients which can communicate with a Tezos network.

	Eztz

## Module 5 - Project

Armed with the knowledge gained from previous modules you will implement a basic use case.

	Use Case
	Smart Contract
	Client

## Module 6 - Smart Contracts II

In this module we will take a deeper look into the details of smart contracts on Tezos, including the core language Michelson.

	OCaml
	Michelson
	Ligo

## Module 7 - Ethics & Future Implications
                        
The final module covers ethics - how to navigate the conflicting interests and agendas that exist in spite, and at times because, of blockchain technology.
